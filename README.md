Bleep bloop, please help Issue Bot 9000 solve all HTML validation errors using the W3C validator.

W3C is the World Wide Web Consortium. Basically, they're a group of people that work to determine the standards of the web. You can thank these people for the awesome things HTML can do, and for the syntax rules we have to follow when writing HTML.

You can also thank them for the W3C validator, which is a service that checks our HTML to make sure it's all written correctly. Remember, HTML governs how and under what search results a web site will show up. Because of this, having properly written HTML is incredibly important for any business's website.

### Let's Get Started

1. In Learn, click `Open`. Once you have the lab open in Nitrous, you'll want to open `index.html`,located in the `lib` directory of this lab, in the Nitrous text editor.

2. Copy the entire contents on `index.html` and paste it in the text box in the [W3C validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input).

3. Once you paste the code, click on `Check` at the bottom to have the validator check your code for any mistakes.

4. Scroll down and take a look at the error messages to correct the code line by line. You won't understand a lot of the instructions (like “Heading cannot be a child of another heading.”) but you WILL be able to see what line the error is in. Just go back to your code and take a look. Based on what you know about HTML see if you can spot the problem (think about what a beginning and tag requires, make sure everything is spelled correctly, etc. Revisit [Lesson: HTML Tags] if you want to check something!)

5. Save the file then re-validate the code again by pasting it back into the validator until all errors are gone. This will make Issue Bot 9000 very happy!

6. When Issue Bot 9000 is happy, make sure you save your changes in Nitrous.  Don't forget to enter `learn submit` in Nitrous in terminal to mark the lab as done in Learn (and store your work on GitHub!).
